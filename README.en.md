## Explanation of terms from the world of artificial intelligence

### 1. What is AI?

KI - or AI - stands for artificial intelligence. It is a branch of computer science that deals with the development of systems that mimic human intelligence.

### 2. Was ist Machine Learning?

Machine learning is used to develop these AIs. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the development of systems that learn from data.

### 3. Was ist Deep Learning?

Deep learning is used to develop these AIs. Deep learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the development of systems.

### 4. What is a neural network?

A neural network is used to develop these AIs. A neural network is a system made up of neurons. These neurons are arranged in layers. Each neuron has a function that is applied to the input. The output of a neuron is the input of the next neuron. The output of the last neuron is the output of the entire network.

### 5. What is a neuron?

A neuron is a mathematical model that has a function. This function is applied to the input. The output is the input of the next neuron. The output of the last neuron is the output of the entire network.

## Application areas of AI

1.  voice recognition
2.  image recognition
3.  image processing
4.  software development
5.  Self-Driving Cars
6.  medicine
7.  games

## AI in software development

1.  code generation
2.  Code Reviews
3.  Refactoring
4.  test generation

### 1. Code generation

AI can generate code. This code isn't always optimal, but it's better than nothing. This code can then be revised by a software developer. This process is called code generation.

### 2. Code Reviews

AI can do code reviews. This process is called code review. This process is very time consuming and expensive. AI can automate this process.

### 3. Refactoring

AI can refactor code. This process is called refactoring. This process is very time consuming and expensive. AI can automate this process.

### 4. Test Generation

AI can generate tests. This process is called test generation. This process is very time consuming and expensive. AI can automate this process.

## Sample application using GitHub Copilot

-   Generate a React App with`npx create-react-app aiexample`
-   Define the path to Google Calendar
-   API`https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/c_5258cab6afd7d5d022df5d55f03d83f416c7cd29d80d1f1bc6f15bfa97d6834d@group.calendar.google.com/events?key=YOUR_KEY`
